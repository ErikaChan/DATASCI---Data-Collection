    "There seems to be limitations for the free version of the account:\n",
    "   1. The full article (or content in this case) is limited to a set amount of characters (260 characters), which means that in order to get the entire article, one needs to upgrade their free account. -> https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines\n",
    "   2. There also seems to be an existing issue in the API where, despite the totalResults showing a value higher than 20, 20 articles will only be retrieved. -> https://github.com/News-API-gh/News-API-python/issues/6"
